  Identify the JSX that is duplicated
  Determine the Purpose of that block of JSX
  Assign it a descriptive name based on what it does
  Create a new file with the same name as the component
  Create a new component in this new file, and paste the JSX into it.
  Make the new component configurable by using React's props system.
